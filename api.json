      "full": "Knockers are mining spirits from Cornish folklore, described as small (around 2 feet tall), bearded creatures dressed like miners who dwell in underground mines. They produce knocking sounds on mine walls that serve dual purposes: indicating rich ore veins to lead miners to valuable deposits, or warning of imminent cave-ins and dangers. Knockers are helpful to miners who treat them respectfully—leaving food offerings and maintaining proper etiquette (never whistling, which offends them)—but can cause cave-ins and mislead those who anger or disrespect them. Folk belief suggests they may be spirits of Jews historically forced to work in mines, or ancient mine spirits predating Christianity. Cornish miners held genuine belief in knockers well into the 20th century, and the tradition was brought to America by Cornish immigrants, evolving into \\\"Tommyknockers.\\\" > ⚠️ **Cultural Sensitivity**: Knockers represent important Cornish cultural heritage and mining community tradition. Treat with respect as legitimate cultural tradition."
